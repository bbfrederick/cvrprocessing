For a new subject, with name sub-XX, do the following, assuming you are in this (code) directory,
and the new dicoms have been placed in ../sub-XX/sourcedata, and the physiological data have
been put in ../sub-XX/physio/CVR_XX.acq (biopac) and ../sub-XX/CVR_XX_pleth.txt (nirs) respectively:


1) Rename the dicom directories to conform to our standard naming:
    step10_renamedicomdirs ../sub-XX

2) Convert dicoms to nifti:
    step20_cvtdcmtonii ../sub-XX

3) Convert and align the biopac data. This is an iterative process. First run:
    readbiopac ../sub-XX/physio/CVR_XX.acq ../sub-XX/physio/CVR_XX_translated.csv --imtimes --noopt --gasdelay=33.6    

    This will generate a plot showing the gas and respiration traces, and the scanner triggers (in black),
    and the estimated positions of the scans from the fmri timestamps (in red).  Functional runs look like solid
    blocks of color because they have markers for every TR - ASL markers come at seemingly random times - so in
    the red trace there is just an envelope function showing the duration of the ASL scans.
    The red timestamps will start at 0.  You'll need to line up the pulse trains.  Basically find a part of the black
    and red traces that are clearly the same, and use the zoom to figure out the locations of the beginning of the same
    block in each trace.  Then rerun readbiopac adding the "--initoffset=XXX" flag, where XXX is the amount of seconds
    to delay the red trace to get it to line up with the black trace.   For example:

    readbiopac ../sub-XX/physio/CVR_XX.acq ../sub-XX/physio/CVR_XX_translated.csv --imtimes --noopt --gasdelay=33.6 --initoffset=1234.0

    Keep zooming in and tweaking initoffset until you are satisfied.

4) Reconstruct the NIRS data:
    plethproc ../sub-XX/physio/CVR_XX_pleth.txt ../sub-XX/physio/CVR_XX_pleth_recon -S 32 -n fingertip 
	
    This converts the raw pleth data into HbO and HbR traces.  Look at the traces - if there are large transients at the 
    beginning or end of the data, you can rerun this to eliminate them using the -s and -e flags, to set the start and end
    times.  If the first 100 and last 300 points are bad, you'd run this:

    plethproc ../sub-XX/physio/CVR_XX_pleth.txt ../sub-XX/physio/CVR_XX_pleth_recon -S 32 -n fingertip -s 100 -e -300

    (Negative points are counted from the end of the dataset.  You could also have used the absolute position, for example
    -e 6540)

5) Now that you have clean data, run readnirs to align the NIRS data:
    readnirs ../sub-XX/physio/CVR_XX_pleth_recon_alldata.txt ../sub-XX/physio/sub-XX_recording-nirsall_physio.txt --imtimes

    readnirs usually aligns data automatically fairly well.  If it doesn't, you can force it to the right offset, just like 
    readbiopac by adding the "--initoffset=XYZ --noopt" to set it iteratively the same way you did above.

6) That's it!  You're ready to go.  Add the final working version of the readbiopac, plethproc, and readnirs commands you used
    to the runbiopacs, runplethprocs, and runnirs files respectively so we have a record of how to process each file.
